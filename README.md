### Process Analysis
This part of assets is primarily focused on custom filters as means to do advanced filtering on top of data sets in Process Mining.

* [Script Filter Basics](process-analysis/filters/00-script-filter-basics.md)
* [Shared Filters from multiple Sources](process-analysis/filters/01-shared-filters.md)

## Enablement and documentations
Installation on-prem, installation on OCP, sizing, user manuals [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/cloudpaks_start/ibm-process-mining/landingpage.html)

[Free IBM Training courses and Badges](https://ibm-learning-skills-dev.github.io/badges/IBM_Process_Mining.html)
Self-paced trainings based on videos from myInvenio. They are showing myInvenio look-and-feel, but the content is 100% applicable to IBM Process Mining.
* Business Analyst is a must have to understand all the features of Process Mining
* Data Analyst covers more technical aspects including data collection, ETL practices, creating filters, creating dashboards, and so forth.
